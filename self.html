                    <h3>Amy A. Wright, “Christ Heals that Which Is Broken”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Christ’s response to this precious daughter of God was ‘Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.’ Another way 
                        to say ‘go, and sin no more; could be ‘go forth and change.’ The Savior was inviting her to repent: to change her 
                        behavior, her associations, the way she felt about herself, her heart.”</p>
                    <p>“With the depiction of this father in the parable of the prodigal son, the Savior emphasized that forgiveness is one of 
                        the noblest gifts we can give one another and most specifically ourselves. Unburdening our hearts through forgiveness 
                        isn’t always easy, but through the enabling power of Jesus Christ, it is possible.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder S. Gifford Nielsen, “This Is Our Time”, April 2021 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Our Heavenly Father wants us to love ourselves – not to become prideful or self-centered, but to see ourselves as he 
                        sees us: we are His cherished children. When this truth sinks deep into our hearts, our love for God grows. When we view 
                        ourselves with sincere respect, our hearts are open to treat others that way too.”</p>
                    <p>“After reading the first two commandments, I detected a third, implied commandment: to love thyself. Have you ever thought 
                        of loving thyself as a commandment? Can we truly love God and His children if we don’t love ourselves?”</p>

                    <h3>President Russell M. Nelson, “Joy Cometh in the Morning”, October 1986 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“The next prerequisite to joy is to feel good about yourself. The second of our Lord’s two great commandments carries a 
                        double charge: ‘Thou shalt love they neighbor as thyself.”</p>
                    <p>“Each individual should understand the nature of his or her own soul.”</p>
                    <p>“Spiritual and physical elements each must be nurtured if we are to earn proper self-esteem. Spiritual self-esteem begins 
                        with the realization that each new morning is a gift from God.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “The Merciful Obtain Mercy”, April 2012 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“When the Lord requires that we forgive all men, that includes forgiving ourselves.  Sometimes, of all the people in the 
                        world, the one who is the hardest to forgive – as well as perhaps the one who is most in need of our forgiveness – is the 
                        person looking back at us in the mirror.”</p>
                    <p>“How do we forgive and have a change of heart? Through the love of God.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Point of Safe Return”, April 2007 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“For our own good, we need the moral courage to forgive and to ask for forgiveness. Never is the soul nobler and more courageous 
                        than when we forgive. This includes forgiving ourselves.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Ronald A. Rasband, “The Things of My Soul”, October 2021 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Love yourself. This is where many struggle. Isn’t it curious that loving ourselves seems to come less easily than loving others? 
                        Yet the Lord has said, ‘Love they neighbor as thyself.’ He values the divinity withing us, and so must we. When we are heavy 
                        laden with mistakes, heartaches, feelings of inadequacy, disappointment, anger, or sin, the power of the Savior’s Atonement is, 
                        by divine design, one of the things that lifts the soul.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Forget Me Not”, October 2011 General Conference, Relief Society Session</h3>
                    <p>“It’s okay of you’re not quite there yet. Keep working on it, but stop punishing yourself……Please remember also to be compassionate 
                        and patient with yourself.”</p>

                    <p>“The commandment not to covet is meant to keep us from hurting ourselves.”</p>
                    <p>“Walk peacefully. Walk confidently. Walk without fear and without envy. Be reassured of Heavenly Father’s abundance to you always.”</p>
                    <p>“He loves each of us—insecurities, anxieties, self-image, and all.”</p>

                    <p>“Wounds and differences can be resolved and even healed when we honor God, the Father of us all, and Jesus Christ, His Son. The Great 
                        Healer of all is our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.”</p>

                    <p>“Regardless of our mental and emotional well-being, focusing on growth is healthier than obsessing about our shortcomings.”</p>
                    <p>“The worth of an individual soul is far more important in the eternal scheme than any earthly task or achievement.”</p>

            <h2>Position Statement</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>I have learned a recurring theme in my study of this topic, that it is a commandment to love ourselves. This 
                        includes forgiving ourselves as well. I have been to a few self-reliance classes, and we are taught this important 
                        truth, we can’t share with others if we have nothing. I feel this truth is relatable to self-love and 
                        self-forgiveness as well. We can’t fully love others or forgive others if we are not full ourselves. I struggle 
                        greatly with this concept. I have no self-love and hold onto guilt, even after repentance. I have come to realize 
                        that I am not being fair to myself or to my loved ones. I have learned so much from reading these conference talks. 
                        I hope to take what I have learned and to change, to love and forgive myself. I want to have strong, loving 
                        relationships and I recognize that the first step to achieving this is to love and forgive myself.</p>
