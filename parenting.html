                    <h3>Elder Gerrit W. Gong, “We Each Have a Story”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Celebrate and become the positive and, where needed, humbly do everything possible not to pass on the negative. 
                        Let good things begin with you.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Bradley, D. Foster, “It’s Never Too Early and It’s Never Too Late”, October 2015 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Our children learn when they are ready to learn, not just when we are ready to teach them.”</p>
                    <p>“As parents in Zion, you have received the gift of the Holy Ghost. As you pray for guidance, ‘it will show unto 
                        you all things what ye should do’ in teaching your children. As you develop processes of learning, ‘the power of 
                        the Holy Ghost carrieth it unto the hearts of the children.’”</p>
                    <p>“There is a difference between hearing and understanding. If our children merely hear but do not understand the gospel, 
                        then the door is left open for Satan to remove these truths from their hearts.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Hugo E. Martinez, “Teaching Self-Reliance to Children”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“We teach these things [self-reliance] to children by our good example, by working and serving with them, studying the 
                        scriptures, and following the teachings of Jesus Christ as taught by prophets.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Dallin H. Oaks, “The Need for a Church”, October 2021 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“We all need associations with others, and church associations are some of the best we can experience, for us and our 
                        companions and children. Without those associations, especially between children and faithful parents, research shows 
                        increasing difficulty for parents to raise children in their faith.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Dallin H. Oaks, “Sins and Mistakes”, October 1996 Ensign, pg. 62</h3>
                    <p>“Before we parents chasten [children] as sinners for committing a wrongful action, we should ask ourselves whether we have 
                        taught them the wrongfulness of that conduct”</p>
                    <p>“We should correct the youthful offenders and promptly teach them correct principles to guide their future actions. 
                        Any repetition would then be a transgression”</p>
                    <p>“If well-meaning parents call teenagers to repentance for teenagers’ numerous mistakes, they may dilute the effect of 
                        chastisement and reduce the impact of repentance for the category of teenage sins that really require it.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Dallin H. Oaks, “Parents and Children”, October 2018 General Conference, Relief Society Session</h3>
                    <p>“Children are our most precious gift from God—our eternal increase.” </p>
                    <p>“Latter-Day Saint women understand that being a mother is their highest priority, their ultimate joy.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder M. Russell Ballard, “Family Council”, April 2016 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Councils are the most effective way to get results...Family councils have always been needed. They are, in fact eternal. 
                        A family council, when conducted with love and with Christlike attributes, will counter the impact of modern technology 
                        that often distracts us from spending quality time with each other and also tends to bring evil right into our homes.”</p> 
                    <p>“Parents need to involve all family members in dealing with challenges and adversity. When council members feel they are 
                        part of a decision, they become supporters and specific positive results can be accomplished.”</p>
                    <p>“If you son or daughter sees you as a staunch supporter, this council meeting can establish goals and objectives for the 
                        future...Children desperately need parents willing to listen to them.”</p>
                    <p>“We can, with Heavenly Father and our Savior’s help, become more patient, thoughtful, helpful, forgiving, and understanding
                         as we pray for help.”</p>
                    <p>“A family council held regularly will help us spot family problems early and nip them in the bud; councils will give each 
                         family member a feeling of worth and importance; and most of all they will assist us to be more successful and happy in 
                         our precious relationships, within the wall of our homes.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder D. Todd Christofferson, “The Voice of Warning”, April 2017 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“A crucial element of the parental duty to warn is to paint not only the demoralizing consequences of sin but also the joy 
                        of walking in obedience to the commandments.”</p>
                    <p>“The motivation for raising the warning voice is love—love of God and love of fellowman. To warn is to care.”</p>
                </section>
                <section> 
                    <h3>Elder Neil L. Andersen, “Whoso Receiveth Them, Receiveth Me”, April 2016 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“While a child’s earthly situation may not be ideal, a child’s spiritual DNA is perfect because one’s true identity is as a 
                        son or daughter of God. President Thomas S. Monson has said: ‘Help God’s children understand what is genuine and important 
                        in this life. Help them develop the strength to choose paths that will keep them safely on the way to eternal life.’”</p>
                    <p>“Let’s open our arms and our hearts a little wider. These youth need our time and our testimonies.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Gary E. Stephenson, “Hearts Knit Together”, April 2021 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“We [parents] have a primary responsibility to set a tone and be role models of kindness, inclusion, and civility—to teach 
                        Christlike behavior to the rising generation in what we say and how we act. It is especially important as we observe a marked 
                        societal shift towards division in politics, social class, and nearly every other man-made distinction.”</p>
                    <p>“The Lord expects us to teach that inclusion is a positive means toward unity and that exclusion leads to division.”</p>

            <h2>Position Statement</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>I have been so impressed with the many talks available, literally at my fingertips, that give great parenting 
                        advice. Let’s be honest, I need each and every one of them. I am guessing with each turn and just hoping for 
                        the best. Thank goodness I have the gospel, prayer, and revelation to help with the guess work of parenting. 
                        The weight of responsibility is immense, with trying to raise good children in the gospel and the community 
                        and to keep them happy and alive. The messages of advice and help were so comforting to me. I learned things 
                        I need to do better and things that will bring success to my family. I have learned the importance I set by 
                        my example. I have also learned that the greatest thing I could do for my children is just love them and try 
                        to treat them as Heavenly Father or the Savior would. When I can accomplish that, I have achieved parenthood.</p>
