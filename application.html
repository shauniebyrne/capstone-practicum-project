            <p>I chose to work on Addiction and Self-Love. I chose to do two because I felt they both went hand in hand. As I worked on my addiction to sugar, my self-love would improve, was my thinking. I chose to show my progress in two ways. The first, I would put a pebble in a jar for each day I was able to not eat any sugar. The second, I would keep a self-love journal and write something good about myself (either from me or from someone else) each night. I was able to achieve 26 pebbles (missed 9 days of the needed 35), and 30 journal entries (missed 5 journal entries of the needed 35). I recognized that staying away from sugar was very hard for me. Even though I new about this goal, I still chose to eat sugar. I need to stay away for health and weight reasons, and still found myself not quite able to stop choosing to eat sugary treats. I also found that I didn’t really believe what was written in my self-love journal. It didn’t help the way I was hoping it would. At Young Women’s camp, we had a therapist come and talk to the girls about mental health. I learned from this therapist why this self-love journal wasn’t working for me. My brain is so hardwired to believe the lies I have been telling it for years, that it can’t hear the good, they don’t resonate as truths anymore. I learned a different method from this therapist for self-love and am planning on trying that path instead. You write down the lies Satan puts in your head about yourself so you can consciously recognize them as lies. Then, when that lie pops up in your head, you think of something else, over and over again until you don’t think of or believe that lie anymore.</p>
