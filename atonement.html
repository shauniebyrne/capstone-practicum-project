                    <h3>President Russell M. Nelson, “The Power of Spiritual Momentum”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“I invite you to seek an end to a personal conflict that has weighed you down. Could there be a more fitting act of 
                        gratitude to Jesus Christ for His Atonement? If forgiveness presently seems impossible, plead for power through the 
                        atoning blood of Jesus Christ to help you. As you do so, I promise personal peace and a burst of spiritual momentum. 
                        When the Savior atoned for all mankind, He opened a way that those who follow Him can have access to His healing, 
                        strengthening, and redeeming power. These spiritual privileges are available to all who seek to hear Him and follow 
                        Him.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder David A. Bednar, “But We Heeded Them Not”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“As we are steadfast in coming unto Christ and are yoked with him, we receive the cleansing, healing, and strengthening 
                        blessings of His infinite and eternal Atonement.”</p>

                    <h3>President Russell M. Nelson, “Joy and Spiritual Survival”, October 2016 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“As in all things, Jesus Christ is our ultimate exemplar, ‘who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross’ 
                        [Hebrews 12:2]. Think of that! In order for Him to endure the most excruciating experience ever endured on earth, our 
                        Savior focused on joy! And what was the joy that was set before Him? Surely it included the joy of cleansing, healing, 
                        and strengthening us; the joy of paying for the sins of all who would repent; the joy of making it possible for you and 
                        me to return home – clean and worthy – to live with our Heavenly Parents and families.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Henry B. Eyring, “Steady in the Storms”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“We find the way in this life to have our natures changed through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. That is the only 
                        way we can build on the sure foundation and so stand firm during the storms of temptations and trials ahead.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Henry B. Eyring, “The Faith to Ask and Then to Act”, October 2021 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“If your faith in Jesus Christ has led to a heart softened through the effects of His Atonement, you will be more 
                        able to feel the whisperings of the Spirit in answer to your prayers.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, “Fear Not: Believe Only”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Life is the most precious of all gifts, a gift which is obtained eternally only through the Atonement of the Lord 
                        Jesus Christ. As the Light and Life of the World, the Only Begotten Son of God came to give us life by conquering 
                        death.”</p>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, “As Doves to Our Windows”, April 2000 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Christ’s perfect life and loving sacrifice constituted literally a King’s ransom, an atonement willingly paid, to 
                        lead us not only from death’s prison but also the prisons of sorrow and sin and self-indulgence.”</p>

                    <p>“Sin is the willful transgression of divine law. The Atonement of Jesus Christ is the gift of God to His children 
                        to correct and overcome the consequences of sin.”</p>
                    <p>“Christ came to save us. If we have taken a wrong course, the Atonement of Jesus Christ can give us the assurance 
                        that sin is not a point of no return.”</p>
                    <p>“It is not repentance per se that saves man. It is the blood of Jesus Christ that saves us.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Ulisses Soares, “In Awe of Christ and His Gospel”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“May the remembrance of what our eyes have seen and our hearts have felt increase our amazement at the Savior’s 
                        atoning sacrifice, which can heal us of our spiritual and emotional wounds and help us draw closer to Him.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder D. Todd Christofferson, “Our Relationship with God”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“The atoning power of Jesus Christ—who descended below all thing and then ascended on high and who possesses all 
                        power in heaven and in earth—ensures that God can and will fulfill His promises.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Dallin H. Oaks, “Strengthened by the Atonement of Jesus Christ”, October 2015 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“In mortality we have the certainty of death and the burden of sin. The Atonement of Jesus Christ offsets these two 
                        certainties of mortal life…Because of that same Atonement, our Savior can provide us the strength we need to overcome 
                        these mortal challenges.”</p>
                    <p>“His Atonement also provides the opportunity to call upon Him who has experienced all of our mortal infirmities to give 
                        us the strength to bear the burdens of mortality.”</p>

            <h2>Position Statement</h2>
            <section>
                <p>The Atonement is a very dear subject to me and has always been close to my heart. I have been instructed 
                    to study about the Atonement and to learn more about it. I feel a deeper love and appreciate for the 
                    Atonement after having been able to study this topic this semester. I am so grateful that the Savior 
                    went through with our Heavenly Father’s plan and suffered, because of love, for us so that we don’t have 
                    to. We are not bound by justice and our sins. What an amazing gift we have been given! I feel a profound 
                    need to not waste this precious gift. I will heed the call and use the Atonement, repenting of my sins 
                    and striving to become better each day.</p>
