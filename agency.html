                    <h3>Elder Quentin L. Cook, “Personal Peace in Challenging Times”, October 2021 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Peace and agency are intertwined as essential elements of the plan of salvation. Agency is the ability and 
                        privilege God gives us to choose and to act for ourselves. Thus, agency is at the heart of the personal growth 
                        and experience that bless us as we follow the Savior.”</p>

                    <p>“We honor individual agency…we seek to help all of His children – not just our own members – enjoy the precious 
                        freedom to choose.”</p>

                    <p>“God has given His children moral agency – the power to decide and to act. The most desirable condition for the 
                        exercise of that agency is maximum freedom for men and women to act according to their individual choices.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Jorg Klebingat, “Valiant Discipleship in the Latter Days”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Moral agency is God’s precious gift to each of His children…God won’t force us to do good, and the devil can’t 
                        force us to do evil.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Quentin L. Cook, “Choose Wisely”, October 2014 General Conference, Priesthood Session</h3>
                    <p>“Rise above any rationalizations that prevent us from making righteous decisions.”</p>
                    <p>“In these areas [the workday world and seemingly ordinary decisions where we spend most of our time], we need to 
                        emphasize moderation, balance, and especially wisdom.”</p>
                    <p>“When we rationalize wrong choices, big or small, which are inconsistent with the restored gospel, we lose the 
                        blessings and protections we need and often become ensnared in sin or simply lose our way.”</p>
                    <p>“Even worthwhile endeavors need evaluation in order to determine if they have become distractions from the best goals.”</p>

                    <p>“As painful as it might be for our Father in Heaven, He will not force anyone to choose the path of righteousness.”</p>

                        honor your agency. You must choose to love Them, to serve Them, to keep Their commandments. Then They can more

                        This agency is one of the greatest gifts of God. With this agency, our Heavenly Father allowed for ‘opposition in 
                        all things’…Opposition should not surprise us. We learn to distinguish good from evil. We rejoice in the blessings of
                        agency.”</p>

            <h2>Position Statement</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Our gift of agency is something that we learn about in the gospel from when we are young in primary. I have heard 
                    the word ‘agency’ many times and recognize it as the gift I have been given from God to choose for myself. I 
                    recognized that this gift was so important, even in the pre-existence, that 1/3 of our Heavenly Parent’s children 
                    were allowed to be lost. I also recognized why agency is so important. It is the way that we show who we are 
                    willing to be and what place we are willing to try to earn after the judgment. Though this gift is a bit daunting 
                    and a big responsibility, I am grateful for the chance to prove myself to Him and be able to choose for myself. I 
                    recognize the importance of choosing the right and allowing my children to do the same. I will strive to do my best 
                    to remember that Heavenly Father has allowed us to choose and make wrong choice, and I need to be able to do the 
                    same for my kids; always being there to help them after.</p>
