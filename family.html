                    <h3>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, “Not as the World Giveth”, April 2021 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“In too many instances, otherwise faithful men, women, and even children can be guilty of speaking unkindly, even 
                        destructively, to those to whom they may well be sealed by a holy ordinance in the temple of the Lord. Everyone has 
                        the right to be loved, to feel peaceful, and to find safety at home. Please, may we try to maintain that environment 
                        there. The promise of being a peacemaker is that you will have the Holy Ghost for your constant companion and 
                        blessing will flow to you “without compulsory mean” forever. No one can employ a sharp tongue or unkind words and 
                        still ‘sing the song of redeeming love.’”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Quentin L. Cook, “Great love for our Father’s Children”, April 2019 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“One adjustment that will benefit almost any family is to make the internet, social media, and television a servant 
                        instead of a distraction or, even worse, a master. The ware for the souls of all, but particularly children, is 
                        often in the home. As parents we need to make sure that media content is wholesome, age appropriate, and consistent 
                        with the loving atmosphere we are trying to create.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Dale G. Renlund, “Preserving the Heart’s Mighty Change”, October 2009 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“In our homes we need to talk of, rejoice in, and preach of Christ so that our children – and we ourselves – will 
                        desire to apply the Atonement in our lives.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>President Russell M. Nelson, “Thanks Be to God”, April 2012 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Marriage and family are ordained of God. The family is the most important social unit in time and in eternity.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Bradley D. Foster,“It’s Never Too Early and It’s Never Too Late”, October 2015 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“It’s never too early and it’s never too late to lead, guide, and walk beside our children, because families are 
                        forever.”</p>
                    <p>“We cannot let society give our family a makeover in the image of the world. We must win this battle. Everything 
                        depends on it. We must be engaged in ‘intentional parenting (President Nelson, April 2015 General Conference)’.”</p>

                    <h3>President, Russell M. Nelson, “Salvation and Exaltation”, April 2008 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“In God’s eternal plan, salvation is an individual matter; [but] exaltation is a family matter.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Henry B. Eyring, “I Love to See the Temple”, April 2021 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“It is in the temple that we can receive the assurance of loving family connections that will continue after death 
                        and last for eternity.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder D. Todd Christofferson, “Why Marriage, Why Family”, April 2015 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“A family built on the marriage of a man and woman supplies the best setting for God’s plan to thrive—the setting 
                        for the birth of children, who come in purity and innocence from God, and the environment for the learning and 
                        preparation they will need for a successful mortal life and eternal life in the world to come.”</p>
                    <p>“Parents should establish families and rear their children in light and truth, leading them to a hope in Christ.”</p>
                    <p>“Marriage is not a human invention. Marriage is indeed ‘from above, from God’ and is as much a part of the Plan of 
                        Happiness as the Fall and the Atonement.”</p>
                    <p>“Many things are good, many are important, but only a few are essential.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Henry B. Eyring, “Eternal Families”, April 2016 General Conference, Priesthood Session</h3>
                    <p>“Every major decision should be based on the effect it will have on a family to qualify for life with Heavenly 
                        Father and Jesus Christ.”</p>
                    <p>“When the Lord speaks to all in the family, His counsel is to love and support each other.”</p>
                    <p>“The most important of the Lord’s work that you will ever do will be the work you do within the wall of your own 
                        home.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Gerrit W. Gong, “We Each Have a Story”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“When asked where meaning comes in life, most people rank family first. This includes family living and gone 
                        before. Of course, when we die, we don’t cease to exist. We continue to live on the other side of the veil. 
                        Still very much alive, our ancestors deserve to be remembered.”</p>
                    <p>“Sometimes unwavering commitment to abiding family relationships helps us accomplish hard things.”</p>
                    <p>“God wants our families to be happy and forever. Forever is too long if we make each other unhappy. Happy is 
                        too short if cherished relationships stop with this life.”</p>

            <h2>Position Statement</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Through this study and reading talks about families, I have been able to better appreciate my families; my immediate 
                    family, extended family, and ward families. I have been able to relearn their importance in not only my life, but 
                    also in the Plan of Happiness. I recognize more firmly that these “family” relationships I am making on earth are 
                    eternal. I have a responsibility to do my best to keep my family relationships strong, spiritual, and important. The 
                    natural man in all of us tends to take for granted what we should cherish the most. I recognize the importance of 
                    making my family relationships my number one priority and doing my best to help them succeed. I am, and will forever 
                    be, grateful for all my families and that those relationships will not end when we die. I have been blessed with a 
                    forever family.</p>
