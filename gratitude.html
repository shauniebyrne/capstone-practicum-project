                    <h3>President Russell M. Nelson, “Thanks Be to God”, April 2012 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“How much better it would be if all could be more aware of God’s providence and love and express that gratitude to 
                        Him. Ammon taught, “Let us give thanks to [God], for he doth work righteousness forever.” Our degree of gratitude 
                        is a measure of our love for Him.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Grateful in Any Circumstances”, April 2014 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Those who set aside the bottle of bitterness and lift instead the goblet of gratitude can find a purifying drink 
                        of healing, peace, and understanding”</p> 
                    <p>“It is difficult to develop a spirit of gratitude if our thankfulness is only proportional to the number of blessings 
                        we can count”</p>
                    <p>“Instead of being thankful for things, we focus on being thankful in our circumstances – whatever they may be”</p>
                    <p>“We can choose to be grateful, no matter what...have gratitude not of the lips but of the soul...true gratitude is an 
                        expression of hope and testimony”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Henry B. Eyring, “Oh Remember, Remember”, October 2007 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Find ways to recognize and remember God’s kindness. It will build your testimony……’Count your many blessings; name 
                        them one by one. And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.’”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>President Russell M. Nelson,“Joy Cometh in the Morning”, October 1986 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Our first noble deed of the morning should be a humble prayer of gratitude.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, “Like a Watered Garden”, October 2001 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“I know I can never repay heaven for any of this benevolence, but there are many ways I need to try to show my thankfulness. 
                        One of those ways is in the payment of tithes and freewill offerings. I want to give something back, but I never want it 
                        to be (in King David’s words) ‘that which doth cost me nothing’.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder David A. Bednar, “Pray Always”, October 2008 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“The most meaningful and spiritual prayers I have experienced contained many expressions of thanks and few, if any, 
                        requests…Let me recommend that we periodically offer a prayer in which we only give thanks and express gratitude. Ask 
                        for nothing; simply let our souls rejoice and strive to communicate appreciation with all the energy of our hearts.”</p>
                    <p>“Expressing gratitude more often in our prayers enlarges the conduit for revelation.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Henry B. Eyring, “Gratitude on the Sabbath Day”, October 2016 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“For Latter-Day Saints, the Sabbath is a day of gratitude and love.”</p>
                    <p>“When we feel gratitude for what He has done for us, we will feel His love for us and our love for Him.”</p>
                    <p>“You and I are witnesses that whenever we have kept our covenants with God, especially when it was hard, He has 
                        heard our prayers of thanks for what He has already done for us and has answered our prayer for strength to endure 
                        faithfully. And more than once He has made us cheerful as well as strong.”</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Gerrit W. Gong, “Always Remember Him”, April 2016, General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“We can always remember Him by gratefully acknowledging His hand throughout our lives. The Lord’s hand in our lives 
                        is often clearest in hindsight.”</p> 
                    <p>“Gratefully remembering the assistance of others and the Spirit’s guiding influence is a way we remember Him. It is 
                        a way we count our many blessings and see what God hath done.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Forget Me Not”, October 2011 General Conference, Relief Society Session</h3>
                    <p>“If we spend our days waiting for fabulous roses, we could miss the beauty and wonder of the tiny forget-me-nots that 
                        are all around us. Don’t close your eyes and hearts to the simple and elegant beauties of each day’s ordinary moments 
                        that make up a rich, well-lived life. The happiest people are those who, thread by daily thread, weave a tapestry of 
                        gratitude and wonder throughout their lives.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Dallin H. Oaks, “Give Thanks in All Things”, April 2003 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Like the pioneers, we should thank God for our adversities and pray for guidance in meeting them. Through that attitude 
                        and through our faith and obedience, we will realize the promises God has given us. It is all part of the plan.”</p>
                    <p>“Let us give thanks for what we are and for the circumstances God has given us for our personal journey through mortality.”</p>
                    <p>“1. The children of God have always been commanded to give thanks. 2. We have so much for which to give thanks. First 
                        and foremost, we are thankful for our Savior Jesus Christ. 3. The revelations, for which we are grateful, show that we 
                        should even give thanks for our afflictions because they turn our hearts to God and give us opportunities to prepare 
                        for what God would have us become. 4.When we give thanks in all things, we see hardships and adversities in the context 
                        of the purpose of life.”</p>
                    <p>“When we understand that God offers us opportunities for blessings and blesses us through our own adversities and the 
                        adversities of others, we can understand why He has commanded us again and again to ‘thank the Lord thy God in all things’ 
                        (D&C 59:7).”</p>

            <h2>Position Statement</h2>
                <section>
                    <p>I was touched by a talk I read long ago that taught me to “think to thank”. Since then, I have made an effort to 
                        read scriptures with this important message and to make sure that I mark them. I am also glad that I took this 
                        opportunity to further my study and have cherished this time to learn more about gratitude in the gospel and how 
                        important it is. I can understand the importance of thanking God for all we have, since we have it because of Him. 
                        I can understand how it would be daunting to give and serve those that don’t say thank you for it and I don’t want 
                        to be that kind of person. I remember many teachings from the Brethren that give the message that gratitude brings 
                        happiness. As a result of this teaching, I am striving to have more gratitude in my life for the things I have been 
                        blessed with and to not take them for granted or to covet that which I don’t have.</p>
