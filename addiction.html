                    <h3>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, “Fear Not: Believe Only!”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>It is precisely because there would be dark days and difficult issues that God promised He would, 
                        out of a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night, guide the prophets, give an iron rod, open a 
                        narrow gate leading to a straight path, and above all grant us the power to finish the course.”</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Henry B. Eyring, “Steady in the Storms”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“In those experiences, we become over time like a child in our capacity to love and obey. We come to 
                        stand on the sure foundation. Our faith in Jesus Christ brings us to repentance and to keeping His 
                        commandments. We obey, and we gain power to resist temptation, and we gain the promised companionship
                         of the Holy Ghost.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Dale G. Renlund, “Preserving the Heart’s Mighty Change”, October 2009 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“We must identify temptations that easily beset us and put them out of reach – way out of reach.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Dallin H. Oaks, “Strengthened by the Atonement of Jesus Christ”, October 2015 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Few disabilities are more crippling to our temporal or spiritual lives than addictions. … That disabling grip
                         can also be relieved by the decisive strength available from the Savior.”</p>
                    <p>“He is perfectly positioned to lift us and give us the strength we need to endure our afflictions. We have 
                        only to ask. He knows our anguish and is there for us.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder M. Russell Ballard, “O That Cunning Plan of the Evil One”, October 2010 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“He [Satan] uses addiction to steal away agency. According to the dictionary, addiction of any kind 
                        means to surrender to something, thus relinquishing agency and becoming dependent on some life-destroying
                         substance or behavior.”</p>
                    <p>“When the pleasure center of our brain is activated by certain drugs or behaviors, it overpowers the part 
                        of our brain that governs our willpower, judgment, logic, and morality. This leads the addict to abandon 
                        what he or she knows is right. And when that happens, the hook is set, and Lucifer takes control. Do not
                         let him hook you with his artificial lures that can quickly turn into addiction.”</p>
                    <p>“Medical research describes addiction as ‘a disease of the brain.’ This is true, but I believe that once 
                        Satan has someone in his grasp, it also becomes a disease of the spirit.”</p>>
                    <p>“Many scriptures testify to us there is hope for the addicted, and this hope comes through the Atonement of
                         the Lord Jesus Christ and by humbling oneself before God, pleading to be freed of the bondage of addiction
                         and offering our whole soul to Him in fervent prayer. Fervent prayer is the key to gaining the spiritual 
                         strength to find peace and overcome an addictive craving. Heavenly Father loves all of His children, so thank 
                        Him and express sincere faith in Him. Ask Him for the strength to overcome the addiction you are experiencing. 
                        Set aside all pride and turn your life and your heart to Him. Ask to be filled with the power of Christ’s pure 
                        love. I testify to you that your body, mind, and spirit can be transformed, cleansed, and made whole, and you 
                        will be freed.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf, “Are You Sleeping Through the Restoration?”, April 2014 General Conference, Priesthood Session</h3> 
                    <p>“Addictions often begin subtly. Addictions are thin threads of repeated action that weave themselves into thick 
                        bonds of habit. Negative habits have the potential to become consuming addictions.”</p>
                    <p>“We are designed to soar freely through the heavens. We are not meant to be shackled to the earth, imprisoned in 
                        straitjackets of our own making.”</p>
                    <p>“Addictions are much easier to prevent than to cure……The best defense against addiction is never to start.”</p>
                    <p>“Always remember, with the Savior’s help, you can break free from addiction. It may be a long, difficult path, but 
                        the Lord will not give up on you. He loves you.”</p>
                    <p>“The most important thing is to keep trying—sometimes it takes several attempts before people find success. So don’t
                         give up. Don’t lose faith. Keep your heart close to the Lord, and He will give you the power of deliverance. He 
                         will make you free.”</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Robert D. Hales, “Becoming Provident Providers Temporally and Spiritually”, April 2009 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“For both debt and addiction, the hopeful solution is the same—we must turn to the Lord and follow His commandments. 
                        We must want more than anything else to change our lives so that we can break the cycle of debt and our uncontrolled
                         wants.”</p>>
                    <p>“Each temptation we overcome is to strengthen us, not destroy us.”</p>
                    <p>“Our success is never measured by how strongly we are tempted but by how faithfully we respond.”</p>
                    <p>“Addiction is the craving of the natural man, and it can never be satisfied. It is an insatiable appetite. When we are
                         addicted, we seek those worldly possessions or physical pleasures that seem to entice us. But as children of God, 
                        our deepest hunger and what we should be seeking is what the Lord alone can provide—His love, His sense of worth, His
                         security, His confidence, His hope in the future, and assurance of His love, which brings us eternal joy.”</p>
                    <p>“Only through our Lord’s Atonement can we obtain a mighty change of heart and experience a mighty change in our addictive
                         behavior. The hunger of addiction can only be replaced by our love for Him.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Dallin H. Oaks, “He Heals the Heavy Laden”, October 2006 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“He knows of our anguish, and He is there for us. We can be healed through the authority of the Melchizedek Priesthood.”</p> 
                    <p>“The healing power of the Lord Jesus Christ—whether it removes our burdens or strengthens us to endure and live with them 
                        like the Apostle Paul—is available for every affliction in mortality.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Thomas S. Monson, “True to the Faith”, April 2006 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“To be safe, we must recognize them [addictions] for what they are and then be unwavering in our determination to 
                        avoid them.”</p>
                    <p>“Each one of us has a body that has been entrusted to us by a loving Heavenly Father. We have been commanded to care
                         for it. Can we deliberately abuse or injure our bodies without being held accountable? We cannot!”</p>
                    <p>“We have the power to resist any temptation and the ability to determine the path we will take, the direction we will
                         travel. Do not be deceived. Pause to pray.”</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Ulisses Soares, “Take Up Our Cross”, October 2019 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Taking upon us our cross and following the Savior requires us to follow His example and strive to become like Him,
                         patiently facing the circumstances of life, denying and despising the appetites of the natural man, and waiting 
                         on the Lord.”</p>
                    <p>“The Savior emphasized that all those who are willing to follow Him need to deny themselves and control their desires,
                         appetites, and passions, sacrificing everything, even life itself if necessary, being entirely submissive to the will
                        of the Father—just as He did. This is, in fact, the price to be paid for the salvation of a soul.”</p>
                    <p>“You need to humble yourself before God, to counsel with appropriate Church leaders, and to repent and forsake your 
                        sins. This process will also bless all who are fighting against debilitating addictions. Taking these steps brings you
                        closer to the Savior, who can ultimately free you from guilt, sorrow, and spiritual and physical slavery. Please never
                        give up after subsequent failures and consider ourself incapable of…overcoming addiction. You cannot afford to stop 
                        trying and thereafter continue in weakness and sin! Always strive to do your best, manifesting through your works the
                        desire to cleanse the inner vessel, as taught by the Savior.”</p>

            <h2>Position Statement</h2>
            <section>
                <p>I have come to learn that I struggle most ardently with a food addiction. I have strived, for many years, through many
                    different means, to overcome this addiction. I have tried many man made solutions, all with no change or reward. I am 
                    addicted to sugar and, because of many tries but no success, have started to tell myself that it doesn’t matter what I
                     do, it wont work. My body just can’t control itself or become better. After reading these talks, I have realized this
                      is false! I have not gone about this process the right way. The only way for me to overcome this strong addiction is 
                    to get help from the Lord. Instead of telling the Lord what I am doing and asking for Him to help me, I have realized I
                     need to ask Him how to achieve success and then do it. I know this road will be long but worth it. I can overcome this
                      addiction but only with the Lord.</p>
