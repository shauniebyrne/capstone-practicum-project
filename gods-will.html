                    <h3>Amy A. Wright, “Christ Heals that Which Is Broken”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Exercising faith in Christ means trusting not only in God’s will but also in His timing. For He knows exactly 
                        what we need and precisely when we need it. When we submit to the will of the Lord, we will ultimately receive 
                        substantially more than that which we had desired.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Walter F. Gonzalez, “The Savior’s Touch”, October 2019 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“At any rate, accepting His will--not our own--will help us understand our circumstances. Nothing bad can come 
                        from God. He knows what is best for us.”</p>
                    <p>“We can come unto Christ with the certainty that His desire currently is and always will be the best for our mortal 
                        and eternal lives. He has an eternal perspective that we do not have. We must come unto Christ with a sincere desire 
                        that our will be swallowed up in the will of the Father, as His was. This will prepare us for eternal life.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder David A. Bednar, “Meek and Lowly of Heart”, April 2018 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“’Saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.’ The 
                        Savior’s meekness in this eternally essential and excruciating experience demonstrates for each of us the importance 
                        of putting the wisdom of God above our own wisdom.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Henry B. Eyring, “Steady in the Storms”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“The prayer that works is ’I want only what You want. Just tell me what that is. I’ll do it.’”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Henry B. Eyring, “The Faith to Ask and Then to Act”, October 2021 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“That feeling of humility can be best described as ‘Not my will, but thine, be done.’”</p>
                    <p>“With sufficient faith, we will ask for direction with the intent to go and do whatever He asks. We will have developed
                         the faith to know that whatever He asks will bless others and that we can be purified in the process because of His 
                        love for us.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Quentin L. Cook, “Conversion to the Will of God”, April 2022 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“I have come to understand that true conversion is the result of the conscious acceptance of the will of God and 
                        that we can be guided in our actions by the Holy Ghost.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Dale G. Renlund, “Consider the Goodness and Greatness of God”, April 2020 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“When we consider the goodness of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, our trust in Them increases. Our prayers change 
                        because we know God is our Father and we are His children. We seek not to change His will but to align our will with 
                        His and secure for ourselves blessings that He wants to grant, conditioned on our asking for them.”</p>
                    <p>“As you act on those words, [‘Hear Him!’], and listen to Him, remember, joyfully and reverently, that the Savior loves 
                        to restore what you cannot restore; He loves to heal wounds you cannot heal; He loves to fix what has been irreparably 
                        broken; He compensates for any unfairness inflicted on you; and He loves to permanently mend even shattered hearts.”</p>

                    <h3>Elder Dale G. Renlund, “Do Justly, Love Mercy, and Walk Humbly with God”, October 2020 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“We can know ‘that the course of life [that we are] pursuing is according to God’s will’ when we do justly, love mercy, 
                        and walk humbly with our God.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Ronald A. Rasband, “Special Lessons”, April 2016 General Conference</h3> 
                    <p>“Trusting in God’s will is central to our mortality. With faith in Him, we draw upon the power of Christ’s Atonement 
                        at those times when questions abound and answers are few.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Dale G. Renlund, “Unwavering Commitment to Jesus Christ”, October 2019 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“Being ‘converted unto the Lord’ means leaving one course of action, directed by an old belief system, and adopting 
                        a new one based on faith in Heavenly Father’s plan and in Jesus Christ and His Atonement…Personal desires that are 
                        contrary to being anchored to the Savior and to following the covenant path fade away and are replaced by a determination 
                        to submit to the will of Heavenly Father.”</p>
                </section>
                <section>
                    <h3>Elder Gerrit W. Gong, “Our Campfire of Faith”, October 2018 General Conference</h3>
                    <p>“We cannot love ourselves enough to save ourselves. But Heavenly Father loves us more and knows us better than we love 
                        or know ourselves. We can trust the Lord and lean not unto our own understanding.”</p>
                    <p>“In this assurance ‘by His grace ye may be perfect in Christ’ is also the comfort, peace, and promise that we can 
                        continue forward with faith and confidence in the Lord even when things do not go as we hope, expect, or perhaps 
                        deserve, through no fault of our own, even after we have done our best.”</p>

            <h2>Position Statement</h2>
            <section>
                <p>I have struggled with this one all my life. I have this deep desire to be in control. This has not led to happiness 
                    though. More times than not, things don’t turn out and often end up worse. I have noticed a theme while studying 
                    this topic, letting go and doing God’s will requires faith, humility, and courage. I understand that I can’t know 
                    His will unless I ask to know. The Holy Ghost will lead me to know God’s will for me. I know without a doubt that 
                    God’s will is always what is best for me. This is something that I know I need to perfect because I often either 
                    forget and just forge ahead or am too stubborn to ask for help. I don’t want to be a burden and to keep asking for 
                    things. I have recognized the foolishness in both of those beliefs and feel strongly the need to find out God’s 
                    will for me and then do it.</p>
